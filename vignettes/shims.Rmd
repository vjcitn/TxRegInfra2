# Overview

In home maintenance, shims are little wedges of wood that you
stick into wobbly entities to make them more stable.

We need things like this to deal with diverse data resources
in genomics.  Here's an example of the problem:

```{r lkshi}
cm = TxRegInfra2:::basicCfieldsMap()
cmdf = as.data.frame(cm)
names(cmdf) = names(cm)
cmdf
```

The rownames of this data frame are target annotation terms for
features of GRanges: chrom, start, end.  The columns are different assay types.
Entry i,j is the notation for feature i on assay type j.  Thus for
eQTL data the start and end can be determined from the source
attribute 'snp_pos', while for footprints (FP) the footprint end is denoted 'end'
and for hotspots (HS) the footprint end is denoted 'chromEnd'.

In order to leave data in its original state but simplify
downstream integration, we use shims like `basicCfieldsMap` to
map attribute names to a common vocabulary.

# Application to RaggedMongoExpt instances

We use `RaggedMongoExpt` instances to work with contents of
a remote MongoDB that holds large volumes of genomic annotation.

## Construction

```{r makecon}
con1 = mongo(url=URL_txregLocal(), db="txregnet")
cd = TxRegInfra2::basicColData.tiny
rme0 = RaggedMongoExpt(con1, colData=cd)
rme0
```

Here `rme0` holds a reference to a MongoDB database, coordinated
with the `colData` component.  (The package includes
a unit test for correspondence between collection names in the
txregnet database and the colData element names.)

## Basic motivation

We'll step back for a moment to give a sense of basic
motivations.  We want to use MongoDB to manage data about
eQTL, DnaseI hypersensitive regions and so forth, without
curating the related file contents.  Here's an
illustration of the basic functionality for eQTL:

```{r lkcon1}
mycon = mongo(db="txregnet", 
   url=URL_txregLocal(),   
   collection="Lung_allpairs_v7_eQTL")
mycon$find(q=rjson::toJSON(list(chr=17)), limit=2)
```

We'll need different `q` components for assays of different
types, because the internal notation used for chromosomes
differs between the assay types.  Other aspects of diversified
annotation can emerge, and the shim concept helps deliver
to the user a more unified interface in the face of
this diversity.

## The `sbov` function

At present, the main workhorse for retrieving assay
results from `r class(rme0)` instances is `sbov`, which
is an approach to a `subsetByOverlaps` functionality.
We'll illustrate this with extractions from lung-related
eQTL, Dnase hotspot, and digital genomic footprinting
results.

```{r dosb}
lname_eqtl = "Lung_allpairs_v7_eQTL"
lname_dhs = "ENCFF001WBZ_hg19_HS" # see dnmeta
lname_fp = "fLung_DS14724_hg19_FP"
si17 = GenomeInfoDb::Seqinfo(genome="hg19")["chr17"]
si17n = si17
GenomeInfoDb::seqlevelsStyle(si17n) = "NCBI"
s1 = sbov(rme0[,lname_eqtl], GRanges("17", IRanges(38.06e6, 38.15e6),
    seqinfo=si17n))
s2 = sbov(rme0[,lname_dhs], GRanges("chr17", IRanges(38.06e6, 38.15e6),
   seqinfo=si17))
s3 = sbov(rme0[,lname_fp], GRanges("chr17", IRanges(38.06e6, 38.15e6),
   seqinfo=si17))
sapply(list(s1,s2,s3),length)
names(mcols(s1))
s3
```

In principle we could avoid the `seqlevelsStyle` manipulation
by checking assay type within `sbov`, but at the moment the
user must shoulder this responsibility.

To see more about how to work with `sbov` outputs, check the main
vignette.
